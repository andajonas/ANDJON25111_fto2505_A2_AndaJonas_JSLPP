# Kanban Task Management Board

A fully functional, browser-based Kanban board for task management with support for localStorage persistence, dynamic task rendering, and a dark/light theme toggle. This project is ideal for organizing tasks into **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done** columns.

## Features

- **Add, edit, and delete tasks** dynamically using modals.
- **Task persistence** with `localStorage` to maintain data across page reloads.
- **Dark/Light theme toggle** for better accessibility and user preference.
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Sidebar toggle** to hide or show navigation for a cleaner workspace.
- **Mobile menu overlay** for navigation and task creation on smaller screens.
- **Loading and error states** for API data fetching (smart persistence strategy).
